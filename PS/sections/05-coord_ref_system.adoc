=== Vertical Coordinate Reference System
In this product there are no direct vertical coordinates which require the use of a vertical coordinate reference system.

=== Temporal reference system
The temporal reference system is the Gregorian calendar for date and UTC for time. Time is measured by reference to Calendar dates and Clock time in accordance with <<iso-8601,clause=5.4.4>>. A date-time variable will have the following 16-character format: _yyyymmddThhmmssZ_.
