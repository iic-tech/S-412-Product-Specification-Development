=== Terms, definitions and abbreviations

==== Use of language

Within this document:

* "`Must`" indicates a mandatory requirement.
* "`Should`" indicates an optional requirement, that is the recommended process to be followed, but is not mandatory.
* "`May`" means "`allowed to`" or "`could possibly`" and is not mandatory.


==== Terms and definitions

*Application Schema*

Conceptual schema for data required by one or more applications.

*Attribute*

(1) Named property of an entity.

NOTE:: Describes a geometrical, thematic, or other characteristic of an entity.

(2) Feature within a classifier that describes a range of values that instances of the classifier may hold.

NOTE:: An attribute is semantically equivalent to a composition association; however, the intent and usage is normally different.

NOTE:: “Feature” used in this definition is the UML meaning of the term.

*Boundary*

Set that represents the limit of an entity.

NOTE:: Boundary is most commonly used in the context of geometry, where the set is a collection of points or a collection of objects that represent those points.

*Coordinate*

One of a sequence of _n_ numbers designating the position of a *point* in N-dimensional space.

NOTE:: In a *coordinate reference system*, the coordinate numbers are qualified by units.

*Coordinate Reference System*

*Coordinate* system which is related to an object by a datum.

*Curve*

1-dimensional geometric primitive, representing the continuous image of a line.

NOTE:: The boundary of a curve is the set of points at either end of the curve. If the curve is a cycle, the two ends are identical, and the curve (if topologically closed) is considered to not have a boundary. The first point is called the start point, and the last is the end point. Connectivity of the curve is guaranteed by the "continuous image of a line" clause. A topological theorem states that a continuous image of a connected set is connected.

*Data Quality*

A set of elements describing aspects of quality, including a measure of quality, an evaluation procedure, a quality result, and a scope.

*Data Type*

Specification of a value domain with operations allowed on values in this domain.

NOTE:: Data types include primitive predefined types and user-definable types.

NOTE:: A data type is identified by a term, for example Integer.

*Dataset*

An identifiable collection of data.

NOTE:: A dataset may be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited by some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type, is located physically within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset may be as small as a single feature contained within a larger dataset. A hardcopy map or chart may be considered a dataset.

*Datum*

Parameter or set of parameters that define the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a *coordinate* system.

*ECDIS*

A navigation information system which with adequate back-up arrangements can be accepted as complying with the up-to-date chart required by regulations V/19 and V/27 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended, by displaying selected information from a System Electronic Navigational Chart (System Database) with positional information from navigation sensors to assist the Mariner in route planning and route monitoring, and if required display additional navigation-related information.

*Enumeration*

A fixed list of valid identifiers of named literal values. Attributes of an enumerated type may only take values from this list.

*Feature*

Abstraction of real-world phenomena.

NOTE:: A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or feature instance should be used when only one is meant.

*Feature*

Abstraction of real world phenomena.

NOTE:: A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or feature instance should be used when only one is meant.

*Feature Attribute*

Characteristic of a *feature*.

NOTE:: A feature attribute type has a name, a data type, and a domain associated to it. A feature attribute instance has an attribute value taken from the value domain of the feature attribute type.

*Feature Catalogue*

A catalogue containing definitions and descriptions of the *feature* types, *feature attributes* occurring in one or more sets of geographic data.

*Geometric Primitive*

Geometric object representing a single, connected, homogeneous element of geometry.

NOTE:: Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that present information about geometric configuration. They include points, curves and surfaces.

*Multiplicity*

Specification of the number of possible occurrences of a property, or the number of allowable elements that may participate in a given relationship.

EXAMPLES: 1..* (one to many); 1 (exactly one); 0..1 (zero or one)

*Point*

0-dimensional geometric primitive, representing a position.

NOTE:: The boundary of a point is the empty set.

*Portrayal Catalogue*

Collection of defined portrayals for a feature catalogue.

NOTE:: Content of a portrayal catalogue includes portrayal functions, symbols, and portrayal context.

=== WMO Product Specification Maintenance

==== Introduction
Changes to S-412 will be released by the WMO as a New Edition, revision, or clarification.

==== New Edition
_New Editions_ of S-412 introduce significant changes. _New Editions_ enable new concepts, such as the ability to support new functions or applications, or the introduction of new constructs or data types. _New Editions_ are likely to have a significant impact on either existing users or future users of S-122. All cumulative _revisions_ and _clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved New Editions.

==== Revision
_Revisions_ are defined as substantive semantic changes to S-412. Typically, _revisions_ will change S-412 to correct factual errors; introduce necessary changes that have become evident as a result of practical experience or changing circumstances. A _revision_ must not be classified as a clarification. Revisions could have an impact on either existing users or future users of S-412. All cumulative _clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved _revisions_.

Changes in a revision are minor and ensure backward compatibility with the previous versions within the same Edition. Newer revisions, for example, introduce new features and attributes. Within the same Edition, a dataset of one version could always be processed with a later version of the Feature and Portrayal Catalogues.

In most cases a new feature or portrayal catalogue will result in a _revision_ of S-412.

==== Clarification
_Clarifications_ are non-substantive changes to S-122. Typically, _clarifications_: remove ambiguity; correct grammatical and spelling errors; amend or update cross references; insert improved graphics in spelling, punctuation and grammar. A _clarification_ must not cause any substantive semantic change to S-412.

Changes in a _clarification_ are minor and ensure backward compatibility with the previous versions within the same Edition. Within the same Edition, a dataset of one clarification version could always be processed with a later version of the Feature and Portrayal Catalogues, and a Portrayal Catalogue can always rely on earlier versions of the Feature Catalogue.


==== Version Numbers
The associated version control numbering to identify changes (n) to S-412 must be as follows:

New Editions denoted as **n**.0.0

Revisions denoted as n.**n**.0

Clarifications denoted as n.n.**n**
