Recommended values for scales can be found in the S-101 ENC Product Specification. Producers should note that at the smaller scales, geographic details will have no perceptible visual separation on a graphic display, and are therefore encouraged to determine display scales taking into account the content and intended navigation purpose of the dataset.

*Language*:: English (Mandatory), other (Optional)

*Classification*:: Data may be classified as one of the following:

. Unclassified;
. Restricted;
. Confidential;

. Protected;
. Limited Distribution.

*Spatial Representation Type*:: Vector
