=== Preface

The “Data Classification and Encoding Guide” has been developed to provide consistent, standardized instructions for encoding S-411 data.

The purpose of the Data Classification and Encoding Guide is to facilitate S-411 encoding to meet JCOMM — ETSI standards for the proper display of Ice Information in an ECDIS. The document describes how to encode ice information considered relevant to be displayed on an ECDIS. The content
of an Ice Information product is at the discretion of the producing authority provided that the conventions described within this document are followed. A “producing authority” is a Hydrographic Office (HO) or an organization authorized by a government, HO or other relevant government institution to produce Ice
Information product.

The entire S-411 Standard, including the S-411 ENC Product Specification, is available at the following web site, https://iho.int/.
